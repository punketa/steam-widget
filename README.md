# Steam Widget for GitHub  

[![Steam Widget](steam-widget.svg)](https://github.com/punketa/steam-widget)

A **self-updating SVG badge** that shows your **Steam profile summary**, **current status**, **level**, **total games owned**, and – when you’re in-game – the **header image of the game you’re playing**.

The badge is **generated automatically every 5 minutes** by a GitHub Actions workflow and saved as `steam-widget.svg` in the repository root.  
You can embed it anywhere Markdown or HTML is allowed:
